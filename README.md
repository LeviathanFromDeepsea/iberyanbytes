# Iberyanbytes

AD enumeration tool, which allows taking information that is related to the network and gathering information about network interfaces, IP configuration, DNS, and routing tables. It enumerates network shares and analyses share permissions, gathers details about installed software, registry software, system configuration, and installed services, and can also get information about local users and user sessions. Get information about domain controllers, sites, trusts, domain users, groups, and group policies. Search password-related files like SAM and SYSTEM.

Tool usage is very simple; you just need to write .\iberianbytes.ps1 and it's fully undetectable at this moment for AV and Endpoint.Â
